A Weather Dashboard

This project aims to create a weather dashboard that fetches and displays weather data from a third-party API - the OpenWeather API. The dashboard will display both the current and the future weather conditions of various cities, aiding travelers in their trip planning. The user can search for a city and be presented with the current weather conditions, including the city name, the date, an icon representing the weather, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed. The dashboard will also provide a 5-day forecast showing similar information. The searched cities will be added to a search history, and users can click on a city in the history to view its current and future conditions again.
To use the dashboard type the name of a city in the search box and select the spyglass. As you search the city will be saved to a list allowing you to select them again for viewing.
